# HMM generator and parameter recovery

Showcasing how to do real-valued time-series generation from parameters:
* initial state probabilities
* state transition matrix
* mean and standard deviation per state

Recovering parameters using [hmmlearn](https://hmmlearn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Added twist is using additional information to help separate highly overlapping state means.
